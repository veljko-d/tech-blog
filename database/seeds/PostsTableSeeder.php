Still, the apps that do not support native 4K and will work in Full HD until support is added.

At the latest Halo tournament at SXSW, Microsoft confirmed that the PC version of Halo: The Master Chief Collection is about to enter its testing stages, with pre-launch tests for Halo: Reach coming first. This will be the first time that the game will be playable on the PC platform. 

At the time of writing, signups for the Halo Insider program are open to the public, with PC gamers being required to provide Microsoft/343i with their system specifications, which are to be given in the form of DxDiag files. This will enable the game\'s developers to select specific hardware configurations if required. Steam accounts must also be linked to your Halo Insider account to be considered for PC testing. 

In the future, the Halo Insider program will also be used for future Halo: Infinite tests, though for now, the system is primarily in place for PC testing for the Master Chief Collection. Former Master Chief Collection (MCC) Insiders need to apply to the Halo Insider program, as members of the former are not automatically part of the latter.',

Today, the USB Promoter Group has revealed its USB4 specification, which thanks to the contribution of Intel\'s Thunderbolt standard will offer 40Gbps of bandwidth, a 2x improvement over USB 3.2 Gen 2X2. 

Yes, this means that Intel has handed over Thunberbolt 3.0 to the USB Promoter group, effectively allowing Thunderbolt 3 to become the next iteration of USB, while also maintaining full backwards compatibility with USB 3.2, USB 2.0 and Thunderbolt 3. 

So why would Intel do this? The answer is simple, market adoption and competition. Starting with Ice Lake, an upcoming 10nm processor from Intel, the company plans to integrate Thunderbolt 3.0 directly onto their processor. This will likely make them the first to support USB4, a factor which will place AMD at a disadvantage until they can offer USB4 support in their devices. 

In a single move, Intel has ensured that their Thunderbolt standard will be adopted by every major manufacturer, while also giving them a clear advantage over their competition when it comes to implementing USB4 support. Thanks to Thunderbolt much of the software/hardware ecosystem for USB4 has already been built, which means that we should see USB4 devices relatively quickly. ',
